    <h1>The Robots</h1>

            <h5>2023</h5>
            <p>Our 2023 robot, F.R.E.D., was built for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zpflsYc4PA">FIRST CHARGED UP competition</a>. F.R.E.D. is a swerve drive robot, allowing him greater mobility and maneuverability on the field. This year we picked up game pieces (cones and cubes) using a two-fingered grabber hand mounted on a telescoping (extendable) arm. He also sports an elevator which allows him to change his reach and center of gravity. </p>

            <h5>2022</h5>
            <p>Our 2022 robot, Hippo Esurientem, was built for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgniEjI9cCM">FIRST RAPID REACT competition</a>. It has a retractable intake arm that can pick up cargo (large tennis balls) and a launcher that shoot them either high or low, by using a motor to spin wheels at thousands of RPM. The robot also sports an extendable climbing hook which enables the robot to get off the ground at the end of the match.</p>
        </div>
        <div onclick="location.href='robot/2020.html'" style="cursor:pointer;">
            <img src="/images/robots/2020.png">
            <h5>2020/21</h5>
            <p>Our 2020/21 robot, Mouse, was built and modified for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmiYWTmFRVE">first</a> & <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I77Dz9pfds4">second</a> INFINITE RECHARGE competitions. The robot has an intake system that shoots powercells at different distances using a motor to feed them into a tower and a piston-mounted wheel to spin the control panel and sensors to detect structure color and proximity. We also installed a scissor lift and winch are also installed to lift the robot during matches.</p>

            <p>Our 2019 robot, Habibti, was built for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mew6G_og-PI">FIRST "Destination: Deep Space" competition</a>. It has an extentable elevator with components that could handle both the hatches and cargo of the challenge with ease. It also has multiple pistons on the bottom to push the robot onto the second HAB level at the end of the game.</p>
